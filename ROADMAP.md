## Phase 0: Governance And Workflow Scaffold

Parent issue: #1

  - [x] Add ignored local working paths.
  - [x] Add transcript and worker-result handling rules.
  - [x] Add governance-rationale planning note.
  - [x] Confirm no private/raw project transcript content is tracked.
- [x] P0.4 Phase closeout, verification, and PR (#5)
  - [x] Run `git diff --check`.
  - [x] Inspect governance Markdown files.
  - [x] Search for private paths, credentials, raw transcript leakage, and
        project-specific contamination.
  - [x] Comment on and close child issues.
  - [x] Open, merge, and verify PR closeout.

Phase 0 acceptance criteria:

- Governance files are tracked and public-safe.
- `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGE_LOG.md`, GitHub issues, and PR body agree.
- All Phase 0 child issues are closed or explicitly deferred before parent
  closure.
- Final local checkout is clean on `main`.
