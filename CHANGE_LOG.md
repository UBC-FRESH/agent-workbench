## 2026-07-04 - Launched Phase 0 governance scaffold

- Created the Phase 0 governance lane for Agent Workbench on
  `feature/p0-governance-scaffold`, with parent issue #1 and child task issues
  #2 through #5.
- Scoped Phase 0 as a governance-only bootstrap: agent contract, contributor
  guide, roadmap, changelog, scratch-space policy, and planning note.
- Excluded package code, CI, docs build, benchmark harnesses, and runtime
  integrations from this first slice.

## 2026-07-04 - Added Agent Workbench governance scaffold

- Added `AGENTS.md` with supervisor/worker agent roles, evidence-based
  reporting rules, file-based handoff/result protocols, and UBC-FRESH issue
  workflow discipline.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `.gitignore`, and
  `planning/phase0_governance_notes.md` so the repository can host public-safe
  multi-agent workflow experiments without contaminating project-specific repos.
- Recorded Phase 0 acceptance criteria and closeout checks before opening the
  first PR.

## 2026-07-04 - Closed Phase 0 governance scaffold

- Verified the governance-only scaffold with `git diff --check`, Markdown
  inspection, and a public-safety search for private paths, credentials, raw
  transcript leakage, and project-specific contamination.
- Closed child issues #2 through #5 with matching completion comments and opened
  the Phase 0 PR back to `main`.
- Merged the Phase 0 PR and verified parent issue #1 closed after the PR landed.

## 2026-07-04 - Launched Phase 1 worker protocol templates

- Created the Phase 1 protocol-template lane on
  `feature/p1-worker-protocol-templates`, with parent issue #7 and child task
  issues #8 through #11.
- Added planned roadmap placeholders for Phase 2 VS Code Chat bridge playbook
  work and Phase 3 worker model evaluation rubric work.
- Kept Phase 1 scoped to Markdown templates and planning notes, with no package,
  CLI, schema, CI, benchmark harness, or VS Code extension.

## 2026-07-04 - Added worker protocol templates

- Added supervisor ticket, worker result, acceptance checklist, and failure
  report templates under `templates/`.
- Added `planning/phase1_worker_protocol_notes.md` with the manual dogfood dry
  run and sanitized findings.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` and `CHANGE_LOG.md` so Phase 1 can close through the
  normal issue, PR, and verification ritual.

## 2026-07-04 - Launched Phase 2 VS Code Chat bridge playbook

- Created the Phase 2 bridge-playbook lane on
  `feature/p2-vscode-chat-bridge-playbook`, with parent issue #13 and child task
  issues #14 through #17.
- Scoped Phase 2 to documenting `code chat --mode agent` launch patterns,
  file-based ticket/result conventions, and supervisor verification boundaries.
- Kept response parsing, VS Code extension work, CLI helpers, schemas, CI, and
  live model evaluation deferred.

## 2026-07-04 - Added VS Code Chat bridge playbook

- Added `playbooks/vscode_chat_bridge.md` with stdin launch patterns,
  `--add-file` context examples, ignored job-file conventions, and supervisor
  verification rules.
- Added `planning/phase2_vscode_chat_bridge_notes.md` with the local
  `code chat --help` command-surface dry run and sanitized findings.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` and `CHANGE_LOG.md` so Phase 2 can close through the
  normal issue, PR, and verification ritual.
